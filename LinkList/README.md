# LinkedList

This is code that is able to essentially act similarly to ArrayLists in Java, as it is able to take most types of data like ints, floats and strings. The use of linked lists allows for the list to vary in length, and the way that this linked list is written is in order to be able to be used with different data types, so there is no need to use more than one type of Link List code.
